      <h2> Mouse Commands </h2>

      <p>
	There are a variety of mouse options for moving objects around the field.
	In all cases you need to first select the object to operate on with the
	mouse button. The selected object will change to a white outline.
	These options are:
	</p>
      <h3> Left mouse button </h3>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Always moves objects to a new position (click'n'drag) in the simulator.
	  </li>
	<li> With shift key it will send a movement command to the robot to the position
	  that is clicked
	  </li>
	</ul>
      <h3> Right mouse button </h3>
      <ul>
	<li> changes robot orientation to point to the mouse location
	</li>
	<li> With shift key it will send a movement command to the selected robot 
	  to orient to point at the mouse location.
	  </li>
	<li> 
	  Gives the ball velocity. Click'n'drag from the ball and you will see the 
	  velocity vector. The length of the vector is plotted in world units so that
	  if it stretches across 1m of field, the ball will get a velocity of 1m/s.
	</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Middle mouse button </h3>
      <ul>
	<li> When <b>soccer</b> is running, it sends a <b>goto</b> command to the 
	  selected robot. The destination of the goto is the position selected by
	  the mouse ie. To use it click on teh robot you want to move, then click 
	  with the middle mouse button where you want it to go.
	</li>
      </ul>
